Smart Lender - Applicant Credibility Prediction for Loan Approval Using IBM Watson
The prediction of credit defaulters is one of the difficult tasks for any bank.
But by forecasting the loan defaulters, the banks definitely may reduce their loss by reducing their non-profit assets,
so that recovery of approved loans can take place without any loss and it can play as the contributing parameter of the bank statement.
This makes the study of this loan approval prediction important. Machine Learning techniques are very crucial and useful in the prediction of these types of data.
